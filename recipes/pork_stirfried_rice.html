        <p>This pork fried rice recipe is my revised version of another recipe. 
            I often substitute chicken for pork, and it doesn't change anything. 
            I have used both basmati rice and long-grain rice which gives the dish only a slight flavor difference. 
            I have also added celery in the past with good outcomes.
